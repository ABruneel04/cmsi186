# cmsi186
Course materials for LMU CMSI 186 Programming Laboratory class, by year.

Currently has Spring 2017, which is legacy from last year.

Also has code for Spring 2018, which is the current version.  Everything in there is empty, an example of how to do something in Java (or at least ONE way of doing it), or is a test harness to be used to test your code during development.
