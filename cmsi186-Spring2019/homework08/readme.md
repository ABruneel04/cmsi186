#### For this homework, you may do both, but you must accomplish at least one of the following activities

Make a Java program, <em><code>PiSolver.java</code></em>, for estimating the value of PI using the basic approach and control structure discussed in class.  Specifically, your program should:
* throw lots of random darts at a unit circle inscribed within a square
* then determine the percentage of darts that fell within the circle
* finally use the formula that we derived to calculate an estimate for PI
* if present, args[0] will specify the number of darts to be thrown [default value = 1000]

#### For folks who have previously solved the above problem or for those who want an extra challenge [or an extra credit point]:
Make a Java program, <em><code>BirthdaySolver.java</code></em>, for estimating the probability that among <code>N</code> randomly chosen people, at least two share a birthday.
1. The value of n will be specified by args[0]
1. your program should simulate one million experiments
1. you should ignore birthdays that fall on February 29, e.g., assume that they have been uniformly distributed among the other days of the year
1. solve this problem analytically, as well â€“ and make sure that your program and your analysis confirm one another!
