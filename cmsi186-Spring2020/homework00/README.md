# CMSI 186: Homework Assignment #0
## Stuff to Get You Started [Setting Up Your Environment]

This is homework number "zero", because as we all know, good computer scientists ALWAYS start counting at zero.
The intent of this homework is to verify that you have an understanding of the following topics:

- You have a working Java development environment
- You have a repository in GitHub
- Your repo allows me access as a contributor so I can upload evaluations, &c.
- You understand making a simple class file
- You understand compiling the class file and running the resulting program

### For this homework, accomplish the following activities:

1. If you're going to be using computers other than those in the Keck Lab, get Java installed and working properly on your various devices. Ask for as much assistance as you need from the TAs or instructors in the Keck Lab
2. If you're going to be using computers other than those in the Keck Lab, get one of the text editors from the syllabus page installed, working, and configured to your taste (syntax colors, indentation, etc.)
3. Create a text file, save it, and re-open it to ensure you are working ONLY with text, none of that "fancy character" stuff; if you have any doubt, try using it to type in a Javascript program that you know works, like a script that alerts something enclosed in double-quotes, then copy it and paste it into the JavaScript "runner"
4. Create a GitHub account and create a project for yourself; go ahead and tailor your user account profile however you want, but remember that this account is likely going to be used for your entire LMU career [and possibly later] so a judicious naming of the account might be something to consider [like first initial, last name or some favorite non-profane nickname â€” things like "GeekPerv" are probably sub-optimal]
5. Read the documentation and find out how to create a directory [or sub-directory, also called "folders"] in your project, then create one for use with this class named "CMSI-186_Projects"; drag and drop your file from step 4 to the directory, then commit the file
6. Inside the "CMSI-186_Projects" directory, create a new sub-directory named "homework00"
7. Oh=n your local computer, use the editor you installed in step 2 to create [i.e., edit] a file called "Greeter.java".
8. Put in the contents as we walked through in class [on day two].  Save the file, then compile, and run the program "Greeter" that was discussed in class; make sure the output is what you expect
9. Back in the browser, click the "upload files" button to get the upload screen.  Drag and drop the file "Greeter.java" to the upload area to "stage" the file.  [You can do multiple files, but you won't need to for this exercise.]
10. Commit the "Greeter.java" program to your "homework00" directory for evaluation by scrolling down to the bottom and entering a short commit message, then click the green "commit changes" button.
11. Pat yourself on the back for completing the assignment!

#### Notes:

In step 5, the GitHub "area" you are now using is officially known as a "repository" and informally as "your git" or "your repo", so don't freak out when you see this word used. When a task or instruction says "commit to your repository" or "commit to your git" or even just "commit", it just means you are uploading the data to your GitHub area.

Submission Guidelines: Make a sub-directory in your repository as mentioned above, called "homework00" and commit your "Greeter.java" source code into it. DON'T FORGET TO ADD A COMMIT COMMENT!""
