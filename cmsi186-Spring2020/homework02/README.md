# CMSI 186: Homework Assignment #7
## More Problems About Estimation
### [Familiarity with Probability Estimation]
### Assignment Due: Monday, 2019-04-20

#### For this homework, you must accomplish the following activities:

Make a Java program, <em><code>BirthdaySolver.java</code></em>, for estimating the probability that among <code>N</code> randomly chosen people, at least two share a birthday.
* The value of N will be specified by args[0] from the command line
* Your program should simulate one million experiments
* You should ignore birthdays that fall on February 29, e.g., assume that they have been uniformly distributed among the other days of the year
* Solve this problem analytically, as well &emdash; and make sure that your program and your analysis confirm one another!

### Notes:
1. Try several different values for the number of people
1. Be sure to try edge cases to make sure they are handled appropriately; e.g., use zero people, a negative number of people, and so on
1. Try writing a command line <q>shell script</q> file to run the program many times and display the output of each run
1. Try repeating tests with the same number of people to see if your program outputs consistent results
